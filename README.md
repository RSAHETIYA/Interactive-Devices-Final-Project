# Interactive-Devices-Final-Project


Functional Checkoff:

Project: Teaching Pianos

Project Group: Sam Willenson and Rahul Sahetiya

Description: Built a functional prototype where one piano is the dedicated student and the other is the dedicated teacher. Teacher piano is capable of playing piano notes and sending respective data to student piano. Student piano is capable of displaying the notes received on the respective LEDs. Unable to create bidirectional sending (although code is there for the function), as decoder got delayed in shipping. This created a physical constraint with respect to our GPIO pins/miniTFT covering some to power all LEDs. Finally, for the housing, vector file has been created and are planning to laser cut in the next two days to complete assembly. Decoder will also arrive tomorrow.

Final Submission:

Project plan: Big idea, timeline, parts needed, fall-back plan.

2. Functioning project: The finished project should be a device, system, interface, etc. that people can interact with.

3. Documentation of design process
4. Archive of all code, design patterns, etc. used in the final design. (As with labs, the standard should be that the documentation would allow you to recreate your project if you woke up with amnesia.)
5. Video of someone using your project
6. Reflections on process (What have you learned or wish you knew at the start?)

7. Group work distribution questionnaire
