# Interactive-Devices-Final-Project


Functional Checkoff:

Project: Teaching Pianos

Project Group: Sam Willenson and Rahul Sahetiya

Description: Built a functional prototype where one piano is the dedicated student and the other is the dedicated teacher. Teacher piano is capable of playing piano notes and sending respective data to student piano. Student piano is capable of displaying the notes received on the respective LEDs. Unable to create bidirectional sending (although code is there for the function), as decoder got delayed in shipping. This created a physical constraint with respect to our GPIO pins/miniTFT covering some to power all LEDs. Finally, for the housing, vector file has been created and are planning to laser cut in the next two days to complete assembly. Decoder will also arrive tomorrow.
